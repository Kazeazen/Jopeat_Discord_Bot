# Jopeat_Discord_Bot
This is a discord bot for my friend's discord server. 
It simply repeats what a very specific user types. 
I'm making this bot because a user on the server was recently hacked. This led to his account spamming and now his account is flagged as a spammer. 
Whenever he types in the discord chat, it blocks out their name and says "Message from likely spammer"

I know that discord lets you see the message if you click see message, however, i wanted an excuse to make a very simple discord bot.
